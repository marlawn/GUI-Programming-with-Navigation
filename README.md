# GUI-Programming-with-Navigation
POS System for a restaurant using JavaFX. Had a model and controller java file and an FXML file (using SceneBuilder) for each view. Included test specification PDF for system testing and generated a JavaDoc folder.

### Navigation Design (Different Views)
* Main view with 4 navigation options:
  * Ordering donuts view (3 general types of donuts at different price points)
  * Ordering coffee view (coffee with 3 different cup sizes and an availability of 4 add-ons with all unique price points)
  * Ordering basket view (view items in basket, remove selected, and place order)
  * Store orders view (details each order and displays amount of each order, can select and cancel any, can export to a file)
